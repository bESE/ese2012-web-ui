1.  First, it initializes and loads the desired data. if it is a GET request, it will then prerender the presentation of
    the data, save the viewState, render it, and unloads the connection (since GET is only used to view, not to edit)
    if it is a POST request, it can be updated during the request and interactively changed. When a change is done, it
    will safe the new data and updates the view. When it is done it behaves like Get (unload data and dispose)
